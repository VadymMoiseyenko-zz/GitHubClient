# GitHubClient
Simple Git Hub Client.

It's very simple, which i create for myself, just for learning.
Main goal is work with open API and using external Android Libraries.
Here you can enter your programing language and location, and then specify searching by entering name in search bar.

I don`t use any UI/UX practise, just implement raw functional.
This app is still BETA, so I in process of Bug fixing 

This project includes:

RecyclerView, Pagination, Refresh layout, JSON parsing with Retrofit 2, load images with Picasso and Glide,
Search bar with request to the server, Explicit and Implicit intents, Create fragments with tabs, Comunication between fragments
Creating float action button and Creating clickable link with Linkify.
